# Descriptive Statistics with PostgreSQL

This repository contains the script and csv file I used for an article '**Descriptive Statistics with PostgreSQL**' I published 
on [Medium](https://blog.devgenius.io/descriptive-statistics-with-postgresql-2811d5215270).

The article explains the most commonly used summary statistics to describe data in exploratory data analysis.
It also give sample codes on how to compute for them in PostgreSQL.
